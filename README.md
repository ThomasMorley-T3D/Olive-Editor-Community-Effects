  - Inside there is `Olive-Editor-Community-Effects-master`

#### For Windows and Mac:
- Open the Olive-Editor installation/portable directory. There is a folder named `effects`
- Copy the extracted folder named `Olive-Editor-Community-Effects-master`
- Paste it in Olive's `effects` folder (for MAC it's probably `Effects`)

#### For Linux
- Open this location: `~/.local/share/olivevideoeditor.org/Olive`
- Create a folder name `effects`
- Copy the extracted forlder named `Olive-Editor-Community-Effects-master`

#### For individual effect downloads:
- Click in the effect folder you want to download

***MUST: you have to make sure the folder COMMON is present in your `effect` folder***
means you should download the `COMMON`folder at least once for individual download.
