# Olive-Editor-Community-Effects
A community effort to populate effects for Olive-Editor

## Install:
Download the zip file and extract it.

## For windows and mac:
open the Olive-Editor installation/portable directory. There is a folder named `effects`>
copy the extracted forlder named `Community_Effects`>
paste it in the `effects` folder (for MAC it's probably `Effects`)


## For Linux
open this location:
`~/.local/share/olivevideoeditor.org/Olive` >
Create a folder name `effects` >
copy the extracted forlder named `Community_Effects`>
and paste it in that `effects` folder.

## Should work from the Olive Editor continuous build after Mar 29, 2019.
